====== Linux In the Real World ======

===== Lesson 2 =====

Netinstall is not fast. Try local mirrors. <br/>

Local Mirrors

<code>
root@server: ls -l /var/www
centos ubuntu index.html
</code>

we use rsync for creating mirrors: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/rsync-command-examples/

<code>
root@server: rsync -a rsync://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu /opt/mirror/ubuntu
root@server: rsync -a --progress rsync://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu /opt/mirror/ubuntu 
(want to see what is going in)
</code>

Use scripts when needed to keep your mirrors up to date. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Rsyncmirror (Ubuntu)

=== Kickstart === 

Note: to start desktop in ubuntu use startx


kickstart files are a recipe for how you want the install to go.
<code>
sudo apt-get install system-config-kickstart
</code>

===== Lesson 3 =====

=== Networking ===
IP Addressing
Private Ranges
Static, DHCP or both

===Ethernet Bonding ===
Most servers now come with at-least two ethernet ports.


  * Public IPs are routable on the greater internet. (They are live) (They are routable)
  * Public IPs should be assigned to a router or a firewall not to the physical server and then have ports forwarded in.
  * Public IPs cost money (facing the internet) If it is a static IP - more expensive
  * for home usage - it can be a dymanic IP .Since you are not running any services from home - you can have a dynamic IP. If I update my DNS with Dynamic DNS - no matter what my IP address change is my DNS remains the same.

  * Public IP is a live IP

=== Private Network ===

In an organization - all the computers will have private IP addresses.
Three sets of IP ranges not routable on the internet, they are only routable privately,
You cannot access them through internet.

<code>
Class C -> 192.168.x.x (256) ----> THIS IS USED EVERYWHERE o.k with home use
Class B -> 172.16-31.x.x (16)
Class A -> 10.x.x.x (1)
What about 240.x.x.x?
</code>

In corporate world - most of the organizations have private IP ranges.

=== Recommendation for setting up a network ===

Avoid Class C in corporate world. 
Nerdy elite 172. Class B range.
172.16-31.x.x (16)

=== Assigning Addresses ===

=== Static ===
Manually assign address to the computer - does not change, Just do it to servers

=== Dynamic (DHCP) ===
Through DHCP server, Dynamic addressing 10.10.10.1- 200

=== Static (DHCP) ===
Static DHCP assigned address - assigned by server, based on rules you set. Assigned every-time systems boot.
=== Rogue DHCP servers ===
Starts handing out incorrect addresses - servers can get addresses they can`t have and you can`t access them (in case you Static DHCP)
