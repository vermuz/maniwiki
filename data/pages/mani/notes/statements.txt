**For Loop, String Continuation
**

<code>
>>> l = ['apple','tomato','oranges']
>>> 'grape' in l
False
>>> 'apple' in l
True
>>> for i in l :
	print (i, len(i))

	
apple 5
tomato 6
oranges 7
>>> l2 = ["This is a long string", \
      "Another one"]
>>> l2
['This is a long string', 'Another one']
>>> s1 = "Super long string \
continuing, etc."
>>> s1
'Super long string continuing, etc.'
</code>

**Escape Characters
**

We don`t want to confuse python by using \n,\t in a statement so just to avoid putting Python into misery of deciphering, what you are trying to talk about use escape chars.

\\n \\t

<code>
>>> ls = '''The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog \
all day long.

More More More More .'''
>>> ls
'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog all day long.\n\nMore More More More .'
>>> print(ls)
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog all day long.

More More More More .
>>> print('CBT Nuggets')

>>> print('CBT\nNuggets')
