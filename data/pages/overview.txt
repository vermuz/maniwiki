====== The Drupal overview ======

===== The Drupal way: manageable abstraction =====

Effective Web design is driven by the need to balance flexibility and simplicity. If a system is too simple, it can only be used for a single purpose - but if it is too flexible, it may be too difficult for new users to learn.

Drupal strives to reconcile these conflicting goals by providing its users with the tools they need to make their own content management solution, while still providing some pre-built components to help them get started. Thus, it can be described both as a content management system (CMS) and a content management framework (CMF) - one system which strives to have the strengths of both, without their deficiencies.

Most CMS's are like a toy boat or truck - specific assumptions have been made about their use, assumptions that would be hard for you to override. Frameworks, on the other hand, provide you with raw materials only - you need to know a programming language and have a clear design vision to put them together.

Drupal is like a Lego kit. Skilled developers have already made the building blocks - in the form of contributed modules - that you need to create a site that suits your needs, whether that is a news site, an online store, a social network, blog, wiki, or something else altogether.

===== Drupal in action =====

To make the contrast between Drupal and other CMS's more concrete, consider the example of a news site. You want to be able to post news articles on the site, and you want the homepage to have a section featuring the five most recent ones. Next, you decide that you want to add a blog section, and put a list of links to the five most recent of blog entries on the homepage as well.

If you were using an ordinary CMS, first you would install a plugin that handled news articles and could put short blurbs on the homepage. Next, you’d install a plugin that would track the latest blog posts and put a list of those on the homepage. Each plugin would only be responsible for tracking and managing a particular kind of content, and would remain relatively isolated from the others.

But, what happens when you have that brilliant middle-of-the-night idea, and want to blend these two functions by showing a list of blog posts about the latest news items, ordered by most active contributor first? If you’re using a “toy truck” CMS, you may be out of luck, or need to hire a developer to write you a custom plugin from scratch. But through the power of the Drupal way, the way of manageable abstraction, you can whip out a kit full of parts and knock this together pretty quickly. (Hint: just use Views.) Since Drupal's modules do things in a standard way, and interface with a common underlying system, building all sorts of clever, customized features is just a matter of snapping parts together.

Of course, this flexibility comes at a certain cost. While a toy truck is instantly understandable and ready to use without much thought, a modular vehicle construction kit will by nature require you to read the instruction manual first. The building blocks are out there, but you'll need to learn how they fit together before you can take a paper prototype and turn it into a full-featured website.

Drupal core, and the thousands of contributed modules that build on it, require an initial investment to learn, but mastering the Drupal way is immensely rewarding; the passionate community is a testament to its power to liberate site builders from the simplicity/flexibility dilemma. Once you've tried Drupal, you'll likely leave your toy truck and boat in the closet gathering dust.

===== How Drupal does it =====

Intrigued yet? Let's take a closer look at how Drupal works.

People often think of a website as a collection of static pages, with some functions (like a blog, or a news engine) thrown in to round it out. When they go to manage their site, they are thinking in terms of a tree-like hierarchy of pages that they will go in and edit.

Drupal, on the other hand, treats most content types as variations on the same concept: a node (more on this in a moment). Static pages, blog posts, and news items (some possible node types) are all stored in the same way, and the site's navigation structure is designed separately by editing menus, views (lists of content), and blocks (side content which often have links to different site sections).

It’s a lot like the separation you find in standards-compliant page coding—XHTML provides the meaningful structure of the information, while CSS arranges it for presentation. In Drupal, nodes hold the structured information pertaining to a blog post (such as title, content, author, date) or a news item (title, content, go-live date, take-down date), while the menu system, as well as taxonomy (tagging of content) and views, create the information architecture. Finally, the theme system, along with display modules like Panels, controls how all this looks to site visitors.

Since these layers are kept separate, you can provide a completely different navigation and presentation of your content to different users based on their specific needs and roles. Pages can be grouped differently, prioritized in a different order, and various functions and content can be shown or hidden as needed.

===== Nodes: The secret to Drupal's flexibility =====

We don't talk about "nodes" every day, but since they are at the heart of Drupal's design, they deserve further investigation. At its most basic, a node is a set of related information. When you create a new blog post, you are not only defining its body text, but also its title, content, author link, creation date, taxonomy (tags), etc. Some of these elements will be shown by the theme layer when the node is displayed. Others are meta-data that control when the node will show up at all - such as taxonomy or publishing status.

Since each item of content is stored as a node, and contains the same basic information, each can be handled in a standard way by both Drupal core and contributed modules. This allows site builders to choose exactly where they want content to show up, and exactly how they want it to look in each case. Most of a Drupal site builder's time is spent defining what kinds of information you want to store in your nodes, and configuring the structures (menus, taxonomy trees, views, panels) in which to display them.

As suggested before, you aren't limited to a single way of presenting your site's content. You can define as many navigation schemes, custom themes ("skins" for the site), blocks (small bits of content, such as the five most recent blog articles described earlier), and feature sets as there are distinct audiences for your site.

Comments are second-class citizens in Drupal compared to nodes, but they also illustrate the Drupal way. Comments aren’t just part of the blog system, since there isn't a separate "blog system." Comments can be enabled on any node type you choose - blog posts, news items, book pages (which provide basic wiki features) and any other you may create.

===== Collaborative at the core =====

Creating an informational website that broadcasts from “one to many” is something that most CMSs do right out of the box. However, where Drupal really shines is when you want to empower site users to create content, and connect with each other - moving from "one to many" to "many to many."

With some CMS's, you can set up a blog, and you can install plugins to handle having a community of users, but what happens when you want to give individual blogs to each of your users, sorting their contents so that they can be displayed individually with their own skins, while also generating cross-blog topical digests, top five lists, and links out to elaborate, customized user profiles? What if you want to also integrate that in with forums, a wiki-like environment, and give each user their own gallery of taggable photos?

Drupal is designed from the ground up so site builders can delegate content creation, and even site administration, to users. All you have to do is define who gets to do what on your site (through user permissions), and then you can start collaborating.

===== Get started quickly, customize extensively =====

Drupal's flexibility is incredible, but installing it is surprisingly easy. With a simple FTP upload and a few short web-based configuration questions, you can connect with your database and have your first Drupal site up and running within an hour.

Pick one of the included themes, and just start adding content. Do you want to have visitors log in? Switch authentication on or off. Want to switch on some of the included tools? Turn on forums; enable commenting on node types; turn on the book module for wiki-like collaboration; create forums and polls; use taxonomy to give site content structured, hierarchical categorization or free-form tagging.

Do you want your own skin applied to the site? Drupal's theme system uses tiny snippets of PHP that you can insert into the appropriate spots in your design to replace your placeholder Lorem Ipsum text with dynamic content. Drupal’s generated markup is clean, standards-compliant XHTML. No old-school tables. No cruft. No kidding.

===== The Drupal flow =====
If you want to go deeper with Drupal, you should understand how information flows between the system's layers. There are five main layers to consider,

{{ :drupal_flow_0.gif |}}

  * At the base of the system is the collection of nodes—the data pool. Before anything can be displayed on the site, it must be input as data.
  * The next layer up is where modules live. Modules are functional plugins that are either part of the Drupal core (they ship with Drupal) or they are contributed items that have been created by members of the Drupal community. Modules build on Drupal's core functionality, allowing you to customize the data items (fields) on your node types; set up e-commerce; programmatically sorting and display of content (custom output controlled by filters you define); and more. There are thousands of different options within the fast-growing repository of contributed Drupal modules. They represent the innovation and collaborative effort of everyone from individuals to large corporations.
  * At the next layer, we find blocks and menus. Blocks often provide the output from a module or can be created to display whatever you want, and then can be placed in various spots in your template (theme) layout. Blocks can be configured to output in various ways, as well as only showing on certain defined pages, or only for certain defined users.
  * Next are user permissions. This is where settings are configured to determine what different kinds of users are allowed to do and see. Permissions are defined for various roles, and in turn, users are assigned to these roles in order to grant them the defined permissions.
  * On the top layer is the site theme (the "skin"). This is made up predominantly of XHTML and CSS, with some PHP variables intermixed, so Drupal-generated content can go in the appropriate spots. Also included with each theme is a set of functions that can be used to override standard functions in the modules in order to provide complete control over how the modules generate their markup at output time. Templates can also be assigned on-the-fly based on user permissions.

This directional flow from bottom to top controls how Drupal works. Is some new functionality you want not showing up? Perhaps you uploaded the module into the system but have not activated it yet, and this is making everything downstream non-functional (as in "A" in the diagram above).

Maybe the module is installed and activated, but you still don’t see what you want on your site. Did you forget to place the block, as in "B"? Or are your user permission settings conflicting with what you want and your users are not set to see the output as in "C"?

Additionally—as mentioned earlier—getting the kind of granular control you want over the details of the XHTML module outputs requires understanding this flow. Are you using a module that does exactly what you want, only you wish the markup was just a little bit different? Maybe you’d like it to use different tags, or you’d like to assign a CSS class to something? You accomplish this by copying the output function from the module and pushing it up to the functions document in your theme. Modify the code there, and when the system goes to output, it will see your customized function and use that instead.

====== General concepts =======

This page discusses some general concepts that will be useful as you begin to explore Drupal. For more details on these concepts you may follow the links to additional documentation.

===== Node (Content) =====

A node is the generic term for a piece of content on your web site. Depending on the type of node, different fields will be attached, and this is known as a content type. For example, a basic Page content type has attached fields such as title and body fields. Other examples of content type are: Book pages for use in Books, Discussion topics in forums, Blog pages in blogs, and News articles.

The word "node" is not meant in the mathematical sense as part of a network.

===== Entity types =====

An entity type is a useful abstraction to group together fields. Entities types are used to store and display data, which can be nodes (content), comments, taxonomy terms, user profiles, or something custom developed.

Read more about Entities in the Entity API documentation.

===== Comment =====

Comments are another type of content you can have on your site (if you have enabled the core Comment module). Each comment is a typically a small piece of content that a user submits, attached to a particular node. For example, each piece of discussion attached to a particular forum topic node is a comment.

===== Taxonomy =====

Drupal has a system for classifying content known as taxonomy. This is provided by the core Taxonomy module. You can define your own vocabularies, or groups, of taxonomy terms, and add terms to each vocabulary. Each vocabulary can then be attached to one or more content types, and in this way, nodes on your site can be grouped into categories, tagged, or classified in any way you choose.

===== User =====

A user is a type of entity which represents a real-world website user. By default, a user has a set of properties including their username, password, role, and e-mail address, however they may also have other properties provided by other modules, and can be extended with new fields. For example, you could add a new Link field for a user's Twitter address.

===== Module =====

A module is software (code) that extends Drupal functionality. Modules fall into one of three categories:

Core modules are those included with the main download of Drupal. These can be turned on or off without downloading additional components. Examples include Blog, Book, Poll, or Taxonomy.
Contributed modules are downloaded from the Modules download section of drupal.org, and installed within your Drupal installation. Examples include Panels, Views or Metatag.
You can also create your own Custom modules. This requires a thorough understanding of Drupal, PHP programming, and Drupal's API.

===== Regions & Blocks =====

Pages on your Drupal site are laid out in Regions. These can include the header, footer, sidebars, and main content regions. Your theme may define additional regions.

Blocks are discrete chunks of information that are displayed in the regions of your site's pages. Blocks can take the form of static chunks of HTML or text, menus (which are for site navigation), the output from modules (e.g. hot forum topics), or dynamic listings that you've created yourself (e.g. a list of upcoming events).

===== Menus =====

There are four standard menus in Drupal 7:

The Main menu is built by site administrators and displayed automatically in the page header of many themes (and if not, you can enable their blocks to display them).

Management is the administration menu, and is presented in the Admin toolbar.

Navigation is a catch-all menu that usually contains links supplied by modules on your site.

User menu contains links to the User account and the log out link.

You can also create your own custom menus, and display them by enabling their blocks.

You can customize menus in several ways, such as reordering menu items by setting their “weight” or simply dragging into place, renaming menu items, and changing the link title (the tooltip that appears when you mouse over a menu item). You can move a menu item into a different menu by editing the Parent property of the menu item.

You can also add custom menu items to a menu, from the Add menu item tab of the Menu administration screen. To create a menu item, you will need to provide the path to the content.

In all cases a menu item will only be shown to a visitor if they have the rights to view the page it links to. For example, the admin menu item is not shown to visitors who are not logged in.

===== Theme =====

The theme controls the appearance of your site, or how your site is displayed, including the graphic look, layout, and colors. A theme consists of one or more PHP files that define the HTML output of your site's pages, along with one or more CSS files that define the layout, fonts, colors, and other styles.

===== Views =====

Although not all sites have Views, most sites include the Views module because of the excellent tools it provides. Views allow people to choose a list of nodes or other entities and present them as pages, blocks, RSS feeds, or other formats. The main use case for views is to create dynamically updating lists to content (for example, a listing of latest news), based on properties of that content (in the case of the news listing, that the content type is “News” and sorted by publication date).

===== Database =====

Drupal stores information in a database. Within this database, each type of information has its own database table. For example, the basic information about the nodes of your site are stored in the Node table, and each field stores its data in a separate table (which Drupal creates automatically). Comments and Users also have their own database tables, as do roles, permissions, and other settings.

The most common database for Drupal is MySQL, however you can also run Drupal on other database systems as well.

===== Path =====

When you visit a URL within your Drupal site, the part of the URL after your base site address is known as the path.

When you visit a path in your Drupal site, Drupal figures out what information should be sent to your browser by checking its list of menu items and routes. Generally, Drupal allows each module to define paths that the module will be responsible for, and when you choose to visit a particular path Drupal asks the module what should be displayed on the page.

For example, the page you are now viewing is http://drupal.org/node/19828, and the path is "node/19828". The module that is responsible for this path is the core Node module, so when you visit this page, Drupal lets the Node module determine what to display.

===== Bootstrap =====

The bootstrap is the CPU (central processing unit) of Drupal. In other interactive software environments this is sometimes called the event loop. Drupal's core is a bit like that. It sits around waiting for a path request, and then starts processing that request.
