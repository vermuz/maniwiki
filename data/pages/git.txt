Make fixes and re-commit. 

**Difference between soft and hard reset
**

When you modify a file in your repository, the change is initially unstaged. In order to commit it, you must stage it—that is, add it to the index—using git add. When you make a commit, the changes that are committed are those that have been added to the index.

git reset changes, at minimum, where your current branch is pointing. The difference between –mixed and –soft is whether or not your index is also modified. So, if we're on branch master with this series of commits:

- A - B - C (master) HEADpoints to C and the index matches C.

When we run git reset –soft B, master (and thus HEAD) now points to B, but the index still has the changes from C; git status will show them as staged. So if we run git commit at this point, we'll get a new commit with the same changes as C.

Okay, so starting from here again:

- A - B - C (master) Now let's do git reset –mixed B. Once again, master and HEAD point to B, but this time the index is also modified to match B. If we run git commit at this point, nothing will happen since the index matches HEAD. We still have the changes in the working directory, but since they're not in the index, git status shows them as unstaged. To commit them, you would git add and then commit as usual.

And finally, –hard is the same as –mixed (it changes your HEAD and index), except that –hard also modifies your working directory. If we're at C and run git reset –hard B, then the changes added in C, as well as any uncommitted changes you have, will be removed, and the files in your working copy will match commit B. Since you can permanently lose changes this way, you should always run git status before doing a hard reset to make sure your working directory is clean or that you're okay with losing your uncommitted changes.

Alex Sexton (5):
      Forces lower case comparison of protocol and host when determining whether the request is remote or local. Fixes #6908
      Moved jQuery.props to attributes since it was only used in support. Fixes #6897 - suggestion by dmethvin
      Changed the expando string to use a random number instead of the time, so collisions become less likely. Also added jQuery version to instantly different
      Moved jQuery global leak to end of file so accidental gEBCN overrides in prototype don't get caught up in confusion. Fixed tests to reference jQuery vari
      A temporary workaround for #8018 that avoids any chance of compatibility-breaking changes until a proper fix can be landed in 1.6.

**Simple Git Fast Forward**

//Move head pointer to the new location
//

<code>
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded
git pull
git pull origin master

</code>

You’ll notice the phrase "Fast forward" in that merge. Because the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you’re on, Git moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a "fast forward".

===== Pulling from Remote =====

**Statements**

git branch -r (Show remote branch)

**Git Pull**

<code>
git fetch; git merge origin/master;
</code>

//__So what is Pull?__// \\

  - Fetch while checking differences and updates
  - Merge the remote master with my local master

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git branch -r
  origin/master

</code>

If we haven`t set up a correspondence between my master branch and the origin(remote) master branch then git will be confused. Git will not know what to do. So, we have to set up an upstream tracking branch.

__//Upstream Tracking Branch//__

What branch remotely does my local branch mirror?

<code>
*********Establish correspondence ***************

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git branch --set-upstream master origin/master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

Pull any new changes down

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
</code>

If we want to avoid establishing upstream

<code>
git pull origin master (Specify remote name and branch that I want to pull in)
</code>

__**Differences between git pull origin master and git pull origin/master**
__

**git pull origin master** will pull changes from the origin remote, master branch and merge them to the local checked-out branch.

**
git pull origin/master** will pull changes from the locally stored branch origin/master and merge that to the local checked-out branch. The origin/master branch is essentially a "cached copy" of what was last pulled from origin, which is why it's called a remote branch in git parlance. This might be somewhat confusing.

You can see what branches are available with git branch and git branch -r to see the "remote branches".

===== Pushing to a Remote =====

===== Creating local branches =====

__Branches are simply labels on SHA1 hashes of individual commits.__

**Statement
**
  * git branch feature1
  * git checkout feature1
  * git lga

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git branch feature1
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout feature1
Switched to branch 'feature1'
*********************************************************
master and feature1 => are both pointing towards efdad19*
*********************************************************
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git lga
* efdad19 (HEAD, tag: v1.0_with_message, tag: v1.0, origin/master, master, feature1) Sharing is easy
* 77676e2 Added gitignore
* f58350e Fixed typo in README.txt and added additional information about other features
* 272b13a Fixed bug 1234
* 82791bb Added cool new feature
* ec750d2 Updated README.txt
* 957304a Added readme

</code>

So, we can make some changes here and see the result.

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ echo "Feature1" >> README.txt

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git status
# On branch feature1
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git commit -am "Added feature1"

**Difference between branches and tags
**

//Branch// (will follow commits, new commits will result in branches moving along)\\
//Tags// (will stay with the commit where they were created) alias for the SHA1 commit

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git lga
* 8748d29 (feature1) Added feature1

===== Renaming and deleting branches =====

To rename branch in Git, we use __move__ option.

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
</code>

//We want to call fix1 as bug1234//

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git branch -m fix1 bug1234

===== Stashing Changes =====

Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the git stash command.

Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory — that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes — and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout feature2
Switched to branch 'feature2'

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ echo "Feature2 changes" >> README.txt

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git status
# On branch feature2
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	Added feature2
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code>

//These changes are not ready to be checked into feature2.//
//I don`t want to lose them.//\\

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash 
Saved working directory and index state WIP on feature2: cdc130d Added feature2
HEAD is now at cdc130d Added feature2
</code>

//Pending changes to the working copy have been rolled back.//

ReadMe file does not contain the change, //echo "Feature2 changes"//

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ cat README.txt
Hello, Git
Hello

Sharing remotely is fun and easyFeature2

</code>

//Those changes are in my git stash, a holding area for pending changes
//

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on feature2: cdc130d Added feature2

</code>

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout bug1234
Switched to branch 'bug1234'

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ echo "Another fix to bug1234" >> README.txt

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git commit -am "Really fixing bug1234"

Checkout feature2 and pull changes back

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git checkout feature2
Switched to branch 'feature2'

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash apply
# On branch feature2
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	Added feature2
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ cat README.txt
Hello, Git
Hello

Feature2 changes

</code>

//You see your changes reapplied.//

Git stash list,

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on feature2: cdc130d Added feature2

</code>

To toss out changes

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git reset --hard HEAD
HEAD is now at cdc130d Added feature2

</code>

We don`t have Feature2  changes now, 

<code>
HEAD is now at cdc130d Added feature2
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ cat README.txt
Hello, Git
Hello
Updating README with new information
Sharing remotely is fun and easyFeature2

</code>

Pop an item from the stash and apply it to current working copy, yep use pop

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash pop
# On branch feature2
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	Added feature2
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{0} (918816032acef183f4dd9e18e56abf2b740cc86b)

</code>

However, the above action despite applying the change from the stash list will remove it from the stash list.

<code>
mani@mani-ubu12x:~/Downloads/gitplay$ git stash list

</code>
