<strong>Exception Handling</strong>
</p>

<p>
When Python experiences an exceptional event. This is throwing an exception or raising an exception <br/>

Raise: We invoke these to trigger exceptions on our terms <br/>

Throw: Exceptions which were not handled. <br/>

</p>

<p>
Raise statement: Manually generate an exception.
</p>

<p>
Try-Except Block
</p>
<pre class="code">try:
   CODE
except __:
   HANDLER CODE
   
finally:
    CLEAN UP</pre>
<pre class="code">**Instantiating an instance of the exception object
raise Exception
** Add extra message
&gt;&gt;&gt; raise Exception(&#039;The flux capacitor is broken&#039;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#3&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise Exception(&#039;The flux capacitor is broken&#039;)
Exception: The flux capacitor is broken</pre>

<strong>Call Stack
</strong>
</p>

<p>
In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just “the stack”.

<strong>Custom Exceptions
</strong>
</p>

<p>
We can use base classes to raise custom exceptions as a sub-class of the std.ex.classes.
</p>

<p>
Note: classes are TEMPLATES.
</p>

<p>
By creating a custom class that inherits from an already existing class, we have immediate access to all of the methods and classes of that class, we inherited from.
We can make changes to the Base classes and let our custom classes inherit those changes from the base classes. Although, we should not tinker with the base classes though.
Encapsulation will allow us to ride herd with the classes and their methods are available to use using the dot notation.
</p>
<pre class="code">class CustomError(Exception)
# pass: null, placeholder statement
# You haven`t done anything in a function but you want to keep it alive
# It will run just fine but will not do anything
      pass

# the base class
