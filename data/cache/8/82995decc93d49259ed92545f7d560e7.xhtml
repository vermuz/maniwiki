<strong>Creating Multiple MySQL Instances</strong>
</p>

<p>
Login to your mysql server as root and execute the following command
It means we are giving shutdown privileges to the user “multi_admin”
</p>
<pre class="code">mysql&gt;GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO &#039;multi_admin&#039;@&#039;localhost&#039; IDENTIFIED BY &#039;secret&#039;;
mysql&gt;FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>

<p>
Come out of mysql prompt and stop mysql server.To stop you can execute
</p>
<pre class="code">[root@localhost ~]#	service mysql stop
or
[root@localhost ~]#/sbin/service mysql stop</pre>

<p>
Now we need to locate the mysql config file “my.cnf” and change it as per our requirement which is located at /etc/my.cnf
</p>

<p>
N:B:-If you are not finding the my.cnf file then go to your mysql installation folder.In my case it is /usr/share/mysql.You will find four configuration files like “my-small.cnf”,” my-medium.cnf”,” my-large.cnf “,” my-huge.cnf”.You can take any one and put it in /etc and rename it to my.cnf.
</p>

<p>
You can also execute the command below to get all of the above file.
</p>

<p>
[root@localhost ~]#	find / -name mysql*.cnf
</p>

<p>
open my.cnf and comment out the following lines in [mysql] section
</p>
<pre class="code"># The MySQL server
[mysqld]
#port           = 3306
#socket         = /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock
# Change following line if you want to store your database elsewhere
#datadir        = /var/lib/mysql</pre>

<p>
Now just below [mysqld] section put the following lines
</p>
<pre class="code">[mysqld_multi]
mysqld     = /usr/bin/mysqld_safe
mysqladmin = /usr/bin/mysqladmin
log        = /var/log/mysqld_multi.log
user       = multi_admin
password   = admin123</pre>

<p>
Then to create our desired two instances add the below lines after [mysql_multi] section. We have to define different unique values for each server instance or else the data and socket files for both servers collide and as a result mysql server will fail to start or your data could be corrupted.
</p>
<pre class="code">[mysqld1]
port       = 3306
datadir    = /var/lib/mysql
pid-file   = /var/lib/mysql/mysqld.pid
socket     = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
user       = mysql
log-error  = /var/log/mysql1.err

[mysqld2]
port       = 3307
datadir    = /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysqld2
pid-file   = /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysqld2/mysql.pid
socket     = /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysqld2/mysql.sock
user       = mysql
log-error  = /var/log/mysql2.err</pre>

<p>
Save the configuration file and now create the files and folders as we have mentioned in the above configuration.To do that execute the following commands.
</p>
<pre class="code">[root@localhost ~]#  mkdir -P /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysqld2</pre>

<p>
For mysql instance 1 we are using the defaults for previously running mysql server But we need to Create the data directory for instance2.Create it by
</p>
<pre class="code">[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysql</pre>

<p>
Copy the mysql database files from the original instance to the second instances database directory and change the ownership of the data directory to the mysql user so the instance can read them.
</p>
<pre class="code">[root@localhost ~]# cp -r /var/lib/mysql/mysql/ /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysql
[root@localhost ~]# cp -r /var/lib/mysql/mysql/ /var/lib/mysql-databases/mysqld2
[root@localhost ~]# chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-databases</pre>

<p>
Now the two instances are ready to run.We can start them by the folowing command
</p>
<pre class="code">[root@localhost ~]#mysqld_multi start
To view the status of the instances you can run
[root@localhost ~]# mysqld_multi report
Output:
Reporting MySQL servers
MySQL server from group: mysqld1 is running
MySQL server from group: mysqld2 is running</pre>

<p>
You can see that the mysqld_multi script has started multiple mysql processes with the following commands.
</p>
<pre class="code">ps -e | grep &quot;mysql&quot;</pre>

<p>
To stop both instances just execute the below command.
</p>
<pre class="code">rhys@linux-n0sm:~&gt; mysqld_multi stop</pre>

<p>
We are also able to control individual instances by referring to the assigned number.
</p>
<pre class="code">rhys@linux-n0sm:~&gt; mysqld_multi stop 1

To verify this
rhys@linux-n0sm:~&gt; mysqld_multi report

Reporting MySQL servers
MySQL server from group: mysqld1 is not running
MySQL server from group: mysqld2 is running

rhys@linux-n0sm:~&gt; mysqld_multi start 1
rhys@linux-n0sm:~&gt; mysqld_multi report
Reporting MySQL servers
MySQL server from group: mysqld1 is running
MySQL server from group: mysqld2 is running</pre>

<p>
Here you need to remember that both the instances running on different port and also having different socket files.
</p>

<p>
<em>Execution Notes
</em>
</p>

<p>
Check for running mysql processes
</p>
<pre class="code">ps aux | grep mysql</pre>

<p>
If a process is not dying, kill it with,
</p>
<pre class="code">kill -9 PID</pre>

<p>
Using killall to kill mysql processes
</p>
<pre class="code"># killall mysqld
# ps aux|grep mysql
root     12288  0.0  0.0  3508  448 pts/0    S+   16:23   0:00 grep -i mysql</pre>

<p>
Connect to instance
</p>
<pre class="code">mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306[PORT-NUMBER] -u root -p</pre>

<p>
Check Mysql status
</p>
<pre class="code">service mysql status
service mysql start</pre>

<strong>Disable and remove AppArmor on Ubuntu based Linux distributions
</strong>
</p>

<p>
AppArmor is security Linux kernel module similar to the SELinux but it’s supposed to be easier to setup and maintain. There are many reasons for you to disable it, primary one is that its security features can get in the way of legitimate applications operation. In this article I’m gonna show you how to disable and remove AppArmor from your Ubuntu based Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
First we stop apparmor service using following command
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor stop</pre>

<p>
Next thing to do is to disable this service from starting at boot time using Debian update-rc.d tool
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo update-rc.d -f apparmor remove</pre>

<p>
And at last if we don’t wont the AppArmor bits on our hard drive sectors we use this command to remove it for good
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo apt-get --purge remove apparmor apparmor-utils libapparmor-perl libapparmor1</pre>

<p>
Where is mysql.cnf
</p>
<pre class="code">There is no internal MySQL command to trace this, it&#039;s a little too abstract. 
The file might be in 5 (or more?) locations, and they would all be valid 
because they load cascading.

/etc/my.cnf
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf
[datadir]/my.cnf
~/.my.cnf

Find all instances of my.cnf
